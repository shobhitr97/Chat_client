  "body": "### OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT \r\n**To develop a backend code for a chat client which allows the peers to chat on groups with 2 or more participants.All the peers can enter and exit the chat anytime and can share files over a wifi or a lan network.This project taught us a lot of things about network sockets and overall networking concepts.**\r\n\r\n###We worked on this project throughout our second semester and the following section shows how we made progress with time:\r\n * #### During the initial stage of our project we were given some reading material to introduce us to python ,github and  network sockets.\r\n\r\n * #### After we finished our reading we were asked to make a simple server-client model in which the chat between two peers is facilitated by a server who passes each receivesd message to  every other client.\r\n####This was later modified to incorporate more than 2 peers.\r\n\r\n * #### Then we switched from server-client to peer to peer model .In this network each peer was connected to every other peer and there was a tracker which kept track of the connected peers and catered to the needs of incoming peers. \r\n\r\n * #### A more enhanced and less complex version of this model had all the peers connected in a circle to form a network .Since they were all connected in a circle,each message traversed the whole circle by sequential passing.This improved the performance of the network.\r\n\r\n * #### Furthermore,we are trying to add capablity to share files over the network.\r\n\r\nLink to the project repository: https://github.com/shobhitr97/Chat_client\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n#####Shobhit Rastogi(@shobhitr97),Kaartik Bhushan,Rohit Gupta\r\n\r\n\r\n",
