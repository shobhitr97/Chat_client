<a id="objective-of-the-project" class="anchor" href="#objective-of-the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</h3>

<p><strong>To develop a back-end code for a chat client which allows the peers to chat on groups with 2 or more participants.All the peers can enter and exit the chat anytime and can share files over a Wi-Fi or a LAN network.This project taught us a lot of things about network sockets and overall networking concepts.</strong></p>

<a id="our-implementation" class="anchor" href="#our-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OUR IMPLEMENTATION</h3>

<p><strong>The network comprises of peers that are connected to each other to form a loop.Every member has a key that recognizes it .Every message has the key of the sender pinned to it.The message traverses the whole through subsequent passing and this stops when the message reaches the sender .
There are two kinds of codes.
One,for the peer that accepts new peers and is run at the beginning of the chat.
The other one runs for all the other peers that simply request the former one for addition to the chat and simply chat.
The former one can't exit the chat until everybody else leaves.</strong></p>
