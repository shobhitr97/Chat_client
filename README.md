# Chat_client
There are various files uploaded on this repository.These are the codes corresponding to various stages that we came across during the course of this project.
The final code that we have developed, basically, has two types of peers -- peer.py  peer__.py .
In this model ,every requests the  peer ,run by peer__.py and is subsequently added to the loop.All the others are run by peer.py  .
  timeout.py is used by both the peers to add timers to their functions.
